# RbRRL-strategy-for-financial-trading

This study proposes a Rule-based Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RbRRL) strategy
for financial trading to bridge the power of data-driven machine intelligence and
the insight from human interpretable industry practice. Technical trading rules from
different classes are combined with regularized weighting approximated by counterfactual
returns and neuron activation. Although the conventional recurrent reinforcement
learning outperforms RbRRL in terms of cumulative capital gain, the latter shows lower
volatility as well as higher interpretability.
